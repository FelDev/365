I'm a big fan of good advice, motivational content, self-help books and the likes.

Here's a little collection of wisdom nuggets I want to keep. Some of it is paraphrased.

### Action cures fear 
\- David J. Schwartz

### Acrasie
Mathieu Ricard introduced me to this French word.

It means: to know what's best for yourself but not doing it for lack of self-control or willpower.
Some easy examples: smoking, drinking, choosing the unhealthy food, not exercising, not meditating, etc... Aren't we all guilty?

### Motivation is like washing your armpits
> Iâ€™ve noticed that people can be quite snobby about books like this. So-called â€˜self-helpâ€™ books. They can be just as mocking of the people who read them or go to motivational talks.
>
> Their main criticism of the kind of books and talks that motivate and inspire people is that the impact is often fleeting - that the effects of the book or talk donâ€™t last.
>
> My response is to say: of course it is fleeting, of course it is temporary. But so are the effects of washing your armpits - thatâ€™s why you should wash them every day!

\- Bear Grylls

### Overnight successes are usually years in the making
\- Tom Clancy, Jeff Bezos and others

### Sleep is like heroin; you'll never feel like you've had enough. Just get up.
\- unknown. (I think I read that as a YouTube comment somewhere ðŸ¤”)

### Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.
\- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

I found this quote particularly relevant when doing video editing.

### We are a way for the universe to know itself.
\- Carl Sagan
