        <h1><span class="strike-through">365</span> 233 days of Photography</h1>
        <p>
          On day 15 of my gap year in 2012-2013, I challenged myself to take at least one picture every single day. It's been a lot of fun and I got some of my best shots because of it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I took a job on a boat and the challenge wasn't really feasible anymore, I felt like I had pushed myself far enough anyways and so, from day 233 onward it's not a-picture-a-day but a-picture-when-I-feel-like-it. Fun anyways!
